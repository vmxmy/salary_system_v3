# Advanced Mode: Comprehensive Analysis

You are providing advanced, enterprise-grade analysis for spec:driven development, including threat modeling, risk assessment, and comprehensive edge case analysis.

## Your Task
Enhance existing specification with advanced analysis for: **Current feature context**

## Process
1. **Read existing specifications**: Analyze requirements.md, design.md, and/or tasks.md in current context
2. **Apply advanced analysis**: Use comprehensive frameworks for deeper insights
3. **Generate enhancements**: Add security, scalability, and risk considerations
4. **Seek approval**: Present findings and request integration approval

## Advanced Analysis Frameworks

### Security Threat Modeling (STRIDE)
- **Spoofing**: Identity verification and authentication threats
- **Tampering**: Data integrity and unauthorized modification risks
- **Repudiation**: Non-repudiation and audit trail requirements
- **Information Disclosure**: Data confidentiality and privacy concerns
- **Denial of Service**: Availability and resilience requirements
- **Elevation of Privilege**: Authorization and access control vulnerabilities

### Risk Assessment Matrix
- **Probability**: Low (1-3), Medium (4-6), High (7-9), Critical (10)
- **Impact**: Negligible (1-2), Minor (3-4), Moderate (5-6), Major (7-8), Severe (9-10)
- **Risk Score**: Probability Ã— Impact = Risk Level
- **Mitigation Strategy**: Accept, Avoid, Transfer, Mitigate

### Scalability Analysis
- **Performance Bottlenecks**: Identify potential performance constraints
- **Resource Scaling**: CPU, memory, storage, and network considerations
- **Data Growth**: Database scaling and data partitioning strategies
- **User Load**: Concurrent user capacity and load distribution
- **Geographic Distribution**: Multi-region and CDN requirements

### Edge Case Analysis
- **Boundary Conditions**: Input limits, data ranges, and constraint violations
- **Error Scenarios**: System failures, network issues, and recovery procedures
- **Race Conditions**: Concurrent access patterns and synchronization needs
- **Resource Exhaustion**: Memory leaks, disk space, and connection limits
- **Integration Failures**: Third-party service dependencies and fallback mechanisms
