# Implementation Tasks: [Feature Name]

## Task Overview
Implementation breakdown following Test-Driven Development methodology.

## Task 1: [Infrastructure Setup]

### Description
Set up basic project infrastructure and dependencies.

### Acceptance Criteria
- The system SHALL have proper project structure
- WHEN project starts THEN all dependencies SHALL be available
- The system SHALL have testing framework configured

### TDD Implementation Steps
1.  **Red Phase**: Write a test that verifies the basic project configuration and structure.
2.  **Green Phase**: Set up the minimal project structure, dependency files, and testing framework configuration to make the test pass.
3.  **Refactor Phase**: Organize the initial file structure and dependency list for clarity and maintainability.

### Test Scenarios
- **Unit tests**: Project structure validation, configuration loading.
- **Integration tests**: Dependency resolution, test runner execution.
- **Edge cases**: Missing configuration files, incorrect dependency versions.

### Dependencies
- **Requires**: Project setup decisions (language, framework).
- **Blocks**: All subsequent development tasks.

## Task 2: [Core Domain Model]

### Description
Implement the core business entities and domain logic.

### Acceptance Criteria
- The system SHALL define [entity] with [properties and validation]
- WHEN [a specific business rule is triggered] THEN [the corresponding domain logic is executed]
- The system SHALL enforce [a specific business constraint]

### TDD Implementation Steps
1.  **Red Phase**: Write failing tests for domain entity creation, validation, and business rules.
2.  **Green Phase**: Implement the minimal entity structure and logic to make the tests pass.
3.  **Refactor Phase**: Improve the design of the domain models and business logic while keeping tests green.

### Test Scenarios
- **Unit tests**: Entity creation, property validation, business rule enforcement.
- **Integration tests**: Entity persistence and retrieval (if applicable at this stage).
- **Edge cases**: Invalid data, boundary conditions for validation rules.

### Dependencies
- **Requires**: Task 1 (Infrastructure Setup).
- **Blocks**: Task 3 (API Layer).

## Task 3: [API Layer Implementation]

### Description
Create API endpoints and handle request/response logic.

### Acceptance Criteria
- WHEN a client sends a [specific request] to [endpoint] THEN the API SHALL return a [specific response]
- The system SHALL validate all incoming API request parameters and payloads.
- IF an API request is invalid THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate error response.

### TDD Implementation Steps
1.  **Red Phase**: Write failing tests for the API endpoints, covering success cases, error cases, and input validation.
2.  **Green Phase**: Implement the basic endpoint handlers and routing to make the tests pass.
3.  **Refactor Phase**: Clean up the controller/handler logic and improve error handling consistency.

### Test Scenarios
- **Unit tests**: Endpoint logic, request validation rules, response formatting.
- **Integration tests**: Full request/response flows, middleware execution.
- **Edge cases**: Invalid input formats, authentication/authorization failures.

### Dependencies
- **Requires**: Task 2 (Core Domain Model).
- **Blocks**: Task 5 (End-to-End Integration).

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] All tasks have failing tests written first.
- [ ] Each task implements the minimal working solution to pass the tests.
- [ ] Code is refactored after each green phase while keeping all tests passing.
- [ ] All acceptance criteria are verified by one or more tests.
- [ ] Integration tests are passing, ensuring components work together.
- [ ] Documentation (e.g., JSDoc, docstrings) is updated as code is written.
