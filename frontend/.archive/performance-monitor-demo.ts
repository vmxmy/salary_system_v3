/**
 * Demonstration of the Performance Monitor fixes
 * This shows the key improvements made to resolve the method chaining issues
 */

// Before fix: This would break because wrapped methods returned promises instead of query builders
/*
OLD BROKEN CODE:
supabase.from('table').select('*').single() // TypeError: .single is not a function

The old implementation wrapped methods like this:
originalQuery.select = function(...args) {
  const result = originalSelect.apply(this, args);
  return performanceMonitor.wrapSupabaseQuery(operation, result, context); // Returns Promise!
};

This broke method chaining because it returned a Promise, not a query builder.
*/

// After fix: Using Proxy pattern to preserve method chaining
/*
NEW WORKING CODE:
supabase.from('table').select('*').single() // âœ… Works correctly

The new implementation uses a Proxy to:
1. Intercept method calls on the query builder
2. Preserve ALL methods in the chain (.single, .eq, .limit, etc.)
3. Only wrap with monitoring at the final execution point (when .then is called)
4. Return proper query builder objects that maintain the full API

Key improvements:
1. Proxy-based interception preserves the complete Supabase API
2. Monitoring happens at execution time, not at method definition time
3. Table name extraction works properly from operation context
4. All query builder methods (.single, .eq, .limit, .order, etc.) are preserved
